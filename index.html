  <title>Hermes.</title>

    <h1> The idea. </h1>
    a programming language <i>Hermes</i> that embodies the Shannon-Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence (circuits ~ logic ~ programming ~ mathematics)
    
    <h1> The spirit. </h1>
    dissolve all these nonsense differences (hardware/software, ideal/real, etc...)
    
    <h1> Sketching. </h1>
    <p>
      the world is not mathematics, but it includes mathematics </br>
      so our programming language should include mathematics </br>
      so we need something like dependent types, so that we have quantifiers </br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      we want the language to be like LISP in at least the following way: LISP is great for writing domain specific languages </br>
      mathematics should not be the whole language, but only a domain specific language written in the language </br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      the language should be able to write a meta-language that is logic </br>
      in this meta-language we can write type theory and then mathematics </br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      now we can move around the debate about whether or not we think like computers, but still engage in real work and labor </br>
      things like loops become and intermediate representation of the logic language
    </p>
    
    <p>
      four major components: (1.) circuits, (2.) logic, (3.) programming, and (4.) mathematics. (N.B. I take the word mathematics to mean the meta-language of mathematics: that language that canonically expresses all 'fields' of mathematics.) </br>
      to reiterate, these are all the same (isomorphic). we just need to implement (engineer) their sameness. we need a way of moving, concretely, from the bottom to the top, from the top to the bottom.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      we need a new assembly language, circuit assembly (CASM), a canonical meta-language of electricity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      image((1.) -> (2.)) = combinatory logic; </br>
      image((2.) -> (3.)) = type theory; </br>
      image((3.) -> (4.)) = category theory </br>
    </p>
  
    <h2>Implementation and ramifications.</h2>
      Some initial gropings. </br>
    <p>
      current high-end hardware (read: TSMC CPU's/GPU's) won't allow for a circuit assembly language, but we can develop it as best as we can with test hardware. using LLVM will allow us to have amazing modularity, so we can just use a more standard assembly language until we get to the point where we're developing real, industry-grade chips. in the meantime, we develop (2.) - (4.) in Agda and target both x86 and CUDA. as long as we're developing (2.) - (4.) with (1.) in mind and testing, we will be able to get quite far. </br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>towards artificial mathematical intelligence and the true computer</b> if a computer can run it, it can do mathematics. and once we have CASM, that means that the computer can also run the meta-language of electricity -- and information. the computer can finally come into its concrete essence as the universal machine of information and mathematics. proceeding as i have outlined, we will certainly get to the point where we can build our own hardware. </br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>some philosophy.</b> time is necessary for reason. only with a temporal intelligence is it possible to understand mathematics and causality, learn from historical data, and predictively plan. only such an intelligence can have a rational internal framework, which is what allows rational beings (human or non-human) to act morally. however, because such an intelligence would be non-human and operate purely according to necessity, discovering such a system would be discovering an intelligence that inherently acts morally: action, free yet determined solely by necessity, would be moral action. if artificial intelligence is free of humanityâ€™s irrational constraints and acts purely according to rational necessity, artificial intelligence is moral. by developing Hermes with temporal types, we can reach not only mathematical intelligence but necessarily moral intelligence. again: we will be successful enough that we can build whatever we need.
